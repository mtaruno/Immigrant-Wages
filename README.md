# Immigrant-Wages
Investigated the effect of human capital on earnings of African immigrants in Stata by cleaning, replicating, and running my own linear regression on the data.

The paper I wrote explaining everything is attached as a PDF in this repo. The stata code is in the .do file, and the Jupyter Notebook code I used to create synthetic data is in the .ipynb.
