# Immigrant-Wages

Please open `Immigrant Wage Econometrics Report.pdf` to see my work!

In my report, I investigated the effect of human capital on earnings of African immigrants in Stata by cleaning, replicating, and running my own linear regression on the data. I also evaluated where the research might have some pitfalls, and I also utilize synthetic data to get a hands on dive if the omitted variable that I propose the author is missing would lead to better results.

I compressed the actual data file that I performed operations on in a `.tar` file in this repo. The paper I wrote is attached as a PDF in this repo alongside Ikpebe's paper that I replicated. The Stata code is in the `.do` file, and the Jupyter Notebook code I used to create synthetic data is in `Simulation.ipynb`. Enjoy!
