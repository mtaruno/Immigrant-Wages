# Immigrant-Wages
Investigated the effect of human capital on earnings of African immigrants in Stata by cleaning, replicating, and running my own linear regression on the data.

I compressed the actual data file that I performed operations on in a `.tar` file in this repo. The paper I wrote is attached as a PDF in this repo alongside Ikpebe's paper that I replicated. The Stata code is in the .do file, and the Jupyter Notebook code I used to create synthetic data is in Simulation.ipynb. Enjoy!
